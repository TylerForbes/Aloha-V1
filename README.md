Aloha Apparel V1 - RED ACADEMY: Project 1
Project Summary

This was the first part of the first project completed as a part of RED ACADEMY's front-end web developer program. Our goal was to create the basic foundation of an e-commerce website using only basic HTML, and CSS. We predominantly used floats to achieve the stylistic results required of us. The site was built to be responsive by implementing a mobile first design.

Languages and tools used:

- HTML
- CSS (with a CSS reset styles, and media queries
- Mobile first approach to design & coding (Responsive Web Design)
